VisualSelect
============

A visual select box originally created (in my spare time) for the then Multplx Attract platform, 
and eventually used in Sandpit Labs (Measuring) Waves. 
Currently requires Require. 

Only keeping this anemic repo around to (pettily and) mildly annoy a "not so good guy" developer.
...but people change. :-)
